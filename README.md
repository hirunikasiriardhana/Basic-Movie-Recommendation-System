# Basic-Movie-Recommendation-System
This project aims to build a recommender system for movies using the TMDb dataset, which includes detailed film information such as plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenue. The system will leverage techniques like content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to predict which movies users might prefer based on their past activity. Key inputs for the system include movie attributes such as budget and popularity, while the outputs are predictions related to movie ratings and success indicators. By analyzing these features, the system will recommend films that align with user preferences and behaviors, enhancing the user experience on information systems or webpages.
